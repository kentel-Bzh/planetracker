Planetracker is meant to help amateur astronomers in the observation of the planets. It calculates for each day of the selected year:

- the distance of the planets from the Sun
- the distance between Earth and the other planets
- the dates of elongations, oppositions and quadratures

Mode of calculation: 
------------------------------
Kepler's Law:  r = a ((1 - e2)/(1 + e cos θ))

for:
r= radius (distance in UA)
a = semi-major axis (1UA for the Earth)
e = excentricity (in degrees)
θ = true anomaly 

with θ = mean anomaly 

θ = n (t - t0), where:
n = mean motion (mean angular velocity = 360°/total year's days)
t = selected day
t0 = date of periapsis

which 



n = angular velocity
t = day
t0 = apsis day
